The first car I fixed was a Ford Probe. It had a distributor problem and wasn't getting spark on any cylinder. It was a very simple problem but oftentimes engine problems can be harder to narrow down. Fixes were often lucky guesses and I began to notice even professional shops operated on this *guess and check* method.

> it is more profitable to attempt repairing the same problem twice then getting it right the first time. So the incentive is undercut.

After I tapped into the scientific method for engine diagnostic, I felt I could solve any problem and began noticing this strategy being successfully employed by others on Youtube (examples: ScannerDanner, DiagnoseDan, South Main Auto)

The main difference is we choose repairs based of evidence instead of symptoms. Symptoms tell us where to look for evidence. We collect data looking for evidence.


## Tools
Some tools are needed in order to collect data and evidence.

### Mulimeter


### Scan tool or AutoTap
A tool that can graph the computer readouts over time is a great help to viewing and understanding data.
