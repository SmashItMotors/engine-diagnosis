Welcome to this guide. It is a work in progress. Use the sidebar to navigate.

This guide exists mostly as notes for myself but I thought it may serve others as well. Sometimes I try to help people on car forums and it's difficult to explain this methodology from scratch every time. There may be checklists or diagrams that don't have a lot of explination or are imperfect as this is still getting built out and is more of a hobby at the moment.
